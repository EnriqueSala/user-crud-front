# User CRUD Front End

#### Notes

This is still a work in progress because I'm still kind of new to React

The credentials used don't have permission to delete users so those options don't work (on purpose). If you want to know more about the back end and the authentication and authorization you can find all the info at [Back End](https://github.com/EnriqueSala/user-crud).



#### About the app

It is a simple front end for my Java Academy final project made using React and axios. You can list, create and update users on a Mysql Database.
